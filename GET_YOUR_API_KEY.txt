⚠️  IMPORTANT: GET YOUR GEMINI API KEY
========================================

Your previous API key was LEAKED and BLOCKED by Google.

You need to get a NEW API key to use the satellite analysis feature.

========================================
HOW TO GET YOUR NEW API KEY:
========================================

1. Open your browser and go to:
   👉 https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

2. Sign in with your Google account

3. Click "Create API Key" button

4. Copy the API key (starts with "AIza...")

5. Open this file in a text editor:
   👉 TerraTrack_BitNBuild/.env

6. Find this line:
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-new-gemini-api-key-here

7. Replace "your-new-gemini-api-key-here" with your actual key

8. Save the file

9. Restart the servers by running:
   👉 START_ALL_SERVERS.bat

========================================
EXAMPLE:
========================================

Before:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-new-gemini-api-key-here

After:
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyABC123YourActualKeyHere

========================================
WHY WAS MY KEY BLOCKED?
========================================

Your API key was accidentally exposed in a public place
(like GitHub, screenshot, or shared code). Google detected
this and blocked it for security reasons.

This is normal and happens to protect your account.
Just create a new key and keep it private!

========================================
SECURITY TIPS:
========================================

✅ DO:
- Keep your API key in .env files
- Add .env to .gitignore
- Never share your .env file
- Create new keys if leaked

❌ DON'T:
- Commit .env files to Git
- Share API keys publicly
- Post screenshots with keys
- Hardcode keys in code

========================================
NEED HELP?
========================================

If you have trouble:
1. Make sure you're signed in to Google
2. Try a different browser
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check Google AI Studio status

========================================

After getting your key, run: START_ALL_SERVERS.bat

Then open: http://localhost:5173

Navigate to: TerraBot → Satellite Analysis

🚀 Happy analyzing!
